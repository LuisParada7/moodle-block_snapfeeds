Feature: Add snapfeeds blocks.

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a Snap feeds block to the main page.
    Given I skip because "It will be reviewed on the ticket INT-19878"
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Snap feeds" block
    Then I should see "This Snap feed has not been configured"
    And I configure the "Snap feeds" block
    When I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_config_feedtype | deadlines |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I turn editing mode off
    Then I should see "Deadlines" in the "Snap feeds" "block"
